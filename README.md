# Hi, I'm Aryan Thakur 👋

**Backend Developer | Applied AI | Building High-Performance Search Systems**

I'm a B.Tech Computer Science (AI) student focused on building scalable backend systems with intelligent search capabilities. I work with modern APIs, databases, and search algorithms to create performant microservices.
